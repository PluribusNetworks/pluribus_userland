NAME
     pkgdepend - image packaging system dependency analyzer

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/pkgdepend [options] command [cmd_options] [operands]

     /usr/bin/pkgdepend generate [-IMm] -d dir [...] [-D name=value]
         [-k path] manifest_path

     /usr/bin/pkgdepend resolve [-dmosSv] manifest_path ...

DESCRIPTION
     pkgdepend(1) is used to generate and resolve dependencies for
     packages.  A package may depend upon files from other packages.
     pkgdepend(1) is typically used in two passes:  file dependency
     generation and file-to-package resolution.

     The generate subcommand examines a package's content and discovers
     what external files the package needs.

     The resolve subcommand takes the list of files from the generate
     step, and figures out the name of the packages, limited to some
     reference set of packages, that contain the dependent files.
     Currently, the reference set of packages is defined as the packages
     currently installed on the publisher's system.

     Several aspects of delivered files are used as sources of 
     dependency information:

     ELF             ELF headers in delivered files are analyzed for
                     dependency information, with the -k and -D options
                     modifying the information obtained.  For more
                     details on ELF dependencies, please see ldd(1)
                     and the Solaris Linker and Libraries Guide.

     Scripts         Shell scripts that contain '#!' lines referencing
                     an interpreter will result in a dependency on the
                     package that delivers that interpreter.

     Python          Python scripts are first analyzed as scripts.  In
                     addition, any imports the script declares may also
                     serve as sources of dependency information.

     Hard links      Hard links in manifests will result in a
                     dependency on the package that delivers the link
                     target.

     SMF             SMF service manifests delivered that include 
                     "require_all" dependencies will result in
                     dependencies on the packages that deliver the SMF
                     manifests that provide those FMRIs.

OPTIONS
     The following options are supported:

     -R dir
          Operate on the image rooted at dir, rather than the one
          discovered automatically.

     --help or -?
          Displays a usage message.

SUBCOMMANDS
     The following subcommands are supported:

     generate [-IMm] -d dir [-d dir] [-D name=value] [-k path] manifest_path
          Produce the dependencies on files of the manifest specified by
          manifest_path.

          With -I, the dependencies which are satisfied within the
          manifest given will be shown.

          With -M, a list of those file types which could not be
          analyzed will be displayed.

          With -m, the original manifest will be repeated with any
          discovered dependencies added after.

          With -d, add the directory provided to a list of directories 
          to search for the manifest's files.

          For each -D, add the 'value' as a way to expand the token
          'name' in run paths for elf file dependencies.

          For each -k, add the path given to the list of paths in which
          to look for kernel modules.  Using the -k argument removes the
          default paths which are /kernel and /usr/kernel.

     resolve [-mov] [-d output_dir] [-s suffix] manifest_path ...
          Transform dependencies on files into dependencies on the
          packages which deliver those files.  Dependencies are first
          resolved against the manifests given on the command line and
          then against the packages installed on the system.  By
          default, the dependencies for each manifest are placed in a
          file whose name is determined by appending ".res" to the
          manifest's path.

          With -m, repeat the manifest, with any dependencies produced
          by the generate step removed, before adding the resolved
          dependencies.

          With -o, write the results to standard output.

          With -d, write the resolved dependencies for each manifest
          provided in a separate file in output_dir.  By default, each
          file will have the same basename as the manifest that was the
          source of the dependencies written to that file.

          With -s, for each output file, append the given suffix (a "."
          will be added to the argument if not provided) to the basename
          of the file that was the source of the resolved dependencies.

          With -S, only resolve against the manifests given on the command
          line and not against those installed on the system.

          With -v, include additional package dependency debugging
          metadata.

EXAMPLES
     Example 1: Generate the dependencies for the manifest written in
     foo, whose content directory is in ./bar/baz and store the results
     in foo.fdeps.

     $ pkgdepend generate foo ./bar/baz > foo.fdeps

     Example 2: Resolve the file dependencies in foo.fdeps, and
     bar.fdeps against each other, and the packages currently installed
     on the system.

     $ pkgdepend resolve foo.fdeps bar.fdeps
     $ ls *.res foo.fdeps.res bar.fdeps.res

     Example 3: Generate the file dependencies for two manifests (foo
     and bar) and retain all the information in the original manifests.
     Then resolve the file dependencies and place the resulting
     manifests, which could be used with pkgsend publish, in ./res

     $ pkgdepend generate -m foo > ./deps/foo
     $ pkgdepend generate -m bar > ./deps/bar
     $ pkgdepend resolve -m -d ./res ./deps/foo ./deps/bar
     $ ls ./res foo     bar

     Example 4: Replace all $PLATFORM tokens in the run paths in elf
     files with sun4v and sun4u while generating the dependences for the
     manifest written in foo whose content directory is in /.

     $ pkgdepend generate -D 'PLATFORM=sun4v' -D 'PLATFORM=sun4u' foo /

     Example 5: Use /kmod as the directory in which to find kernel
     modules when generating the dependencies for the manifest written
     in foo whose content directory is in /.

     $ pkgdepend generate -k /kmod foo /
