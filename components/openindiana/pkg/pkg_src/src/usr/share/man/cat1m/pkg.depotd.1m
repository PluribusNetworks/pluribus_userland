DESCRIPTION
     pkg.depotd is the depot server for the image packaging system.
     It provides clients network access to the data contained within a
     package repository.  pkg(1), the retrieval client, makes requests
     to the depot server for catalogs and packages.  pkgsend(1), the
     publication client, sends new versions of packages to the depot
     server.  pkgrepo(1) provides creation, management, and summary
     functionality for repositories.  pkg.depotd is typically run as
     a service on the system.  Package and software developers may
     wish to run private copies for various testing purposes.

     The depot currently does not provide any access control methods
     of its own.  By default, all clients able to connect are able to
     read all data publish new package versions (when running under
     SMF, the default is to run in a read-only mode).  The NOTES
     section below describes some best practices for maintaining
     a public depot with evolving content.

     The pkg.depot server is generally configured via the smf(5)
     properties associated with its service.  The following
     properties are recognized:

     pkg/content_root           (astring) The file system path at
                                which
                                the instance should find its static
                                and other web content.  The default
                                value is /usr/share/lib/pkg.

     pkg/debug                  (astring) A comma-separated list of
                                debug features to enable.  Possible
                                values are:

                                  headers
                                        Logs the headers of every
                                        request to the error log.

     pkg/default_publisher      (astring) The name of the default
                                publisher for packages.  This value
                                is used when an operation is requested
                                that requires publisher identity and
                                one has not been provided.  Required
                                unless mirror mode is active.

     pkg/disable_ops            (astring) A comma-separated list of
                                operations that should be disabled for
                                the depot server.  Operations are
                                given as <operation>[/<version>]
                                (e.g. catalog, search_1).

     pkg/file_root              (astring) The root of the file content
                                for this repository.  If undefined,
                                this defaults to <inst_root>/file.

     pkg/inst_root              (astring) The file system path at
                                which the instance should find its
                                repository data.  Required unless
                                file_root or PKG_REPO has been
                                provided.  The default value is
                                /var/pkg/repo.

     pkg/log_access             (astring) The destination for any
                                access related information logged by
                                the depot process.  Possible values
                                are: stderr, stdout, none, or an
                                absolute pathname.  The default value
                                is stdout if stdout is a tty; if it
                                is not a tty, the default value is
                                none.

     pkg/log_errors             (astring) The destination for any
                                errors or other information logged by
                                the depot process.  Possible values
                                are: stderr, stdout, none, or an
                                absolute pathname.  The default value
                                is stderr.

     pkg/mirror                 (boolean) Sets whether package mirror
                                mode is used.  When true, publishing
                                and metadata operations are disabled
                                and only a limited browser user
                                interface is provided.  This property
                                may not be true when the pkg/readonly
                                property is true.  The default value
                                is false.

     pkg/port                   (count) The port number on which the
                                instance should listen for incoming
                                package requests.  The default value
                                is 80 if ssl certificate and key
                                information has not been provided;
                                otherwise, the default value is 443.

     pkg/proxy_base             (uri) This changes the base URL for
                                the depot server and is most useful
                                when running behind Apache or some
                                other webserver in a reverse proxy
                                configuration.

     pkg/readonly               (boolean) Sets whether modifying
                                operations, such as those initiated
                                by pkgsend(1M) are disabled. Retrieval
                                operations are still available. This
                                property may not be true when the
                                pkg/mirror property is true. The
                                default value is true.

     pkg/socket_timeout         (count) The maximum number of seconds
                                the server should wait for a response
                                from a client before closing a conn-
                                ection.  The default value is 60.

     pkg/sort_file_max_size     (count) The maximum size of the
                                indexer sort file. Used to limit the
                                amount of RAM the depot uses for
                                indexing, or increase it for speed.

     pkg/ssl_cert_file          (astring) The absolute pathname to a
                                PEM-encoded Certificate file.  The
                                default value is none.  This property
                                must be used with ssl_key_file.  The
                                depot will only respond to SSL
                                requests if provided.

     pkg/ssl_dialog             (astring) Specifies what method should
                                be used to obtain the passphrase used
                                to decrypt the ssl_key_file.  Possible
                                values are: exec:/path/to/program,
                                builtin, or smf:fmri.  builtin will
                                prompt for the passphrase; exec will
                                execute the specified external program
                                to obtain the passphrase, which should
                                be printed to stdout.  The first
                                argument to the program will be '',
                                and is reserved.  The second argument
                                to the program will be the port number
                                of the server.  smf:fmri will attempt
                                to retrieve the value of the property
                                pkg_secure/ssl_key_passphrase from the
                                service instance related to the fmri.
                                The default value is builtin.

     pkg/ssl_key_file           (astring) The absolute pathname to a
                                PEM-encoded Private Key file.  This
                                property must be used with the
                                property ssl_cert_file.  The depot
                                will only respond to SSL requests if
                                provided.

     pkg/threads                (count) The number of threads that
                                will be started to serve requests.
                                The default value is 10.

     pkg/writable_root          (astring) The file system path to a
                                directory to which the program has
                                write access.  This is used with
                                --readonly to allow the depot server
                                to create files, such as search
                                indices, without needing write
                                access to the package information.

     pkg_secure/ssl_key_passphrase (astring) The password to use to
                                   decrypt the pkg/ssl_key_file.
                                   This value is read-authorization
                                   protected using the attribute
                                   'solaris.smf.read.pkg-server'.

     The presentation and behaviour of the Browser User Interface
     (BUI) of the depot server is controlled using the following
     properties:

     pkg_bui/feed_description   (astring) A descriptive paragraph
                                for the RSS/Atom feed.

     pkg_bui/feed_icon          (astring) The pathname of a small
                                image that will be used to visually
                                represent the RSS/Atom feed.  The
                                pathname should be relative to the
                                content_root.  The default value is
                                "web/_themes/pkg-block-icon.png"

     pkg_bui/feed_logo          (astring) The pathname of a large
                                image that will be used to visually
                                brand or identify the RSS/Atom feed.
                                This value should be relative to the
                                content_root.  The default value is
                                "web/_themes/pkg-block-icon.png".

     pkg_bui/feed_name          (astring) A short, descriptive name
                                for RSS/Atom feeds generated by the
                                depot serving the repository.  The
                                default value is "package repository
                                feed".

     pkg_bui/feed_window        (count) A numeric value representing
                                the number of hours, before the feed
                                for the repository was last generated,
                                to include when generating the feed.

     The pkg depot is also able to act as a mirror server for local
     client images from pkg(5).  This allows clients that share a
     subnet on a LAN to mirror their file caches.  Clients may
     download files from one another, thereby reducing load on the
     package depot server.  This functionality is available as an
     alternate depot service configured by smf(5).  It uses mDNS and
     dns-sd for service discovery.

     The mDNS mirror is generally configured via the smf(5) properties
     associated with its service.  The following properties are
     recognized:

     pkg/file_root  (astring) The file system path at which the
                    instance should find its file content.  The
                    default value is /var/pkg/download.

     pkg/port       (count) The port number on which the instance
                    should listen for incoming package requests.
                    The default value is 80.

OPTIONS
     pkg.depotd(1m) can read its base configuration information from
     a file or from the property data of an existing smf(5) service
     instance:

     --cfg source   The pathname of the file to use when reading and
                    writing configuration data, or a string of the
                    form 'smf:fmri' where fmri is the service fault
                    management resource identifier (FMRI) of the
                    instance to read configuration data from.  See
                    DEPOT CONFIGURATION below for details on the
                    format of the file specified.

     If no pre-existing configuration source is available, or to
     override values read from a provided configuration file using
     '--cfg', the following options can be used to alter the default
     behavior of the depot server:

     -d repo_dir                See pkg/repo_dir above.

     -p port                    See pkg/port above.

     -s threads                 See pkg/threads above.

     -t socket_timeout          See pkg/socket_timeout above.

     --content-root root_dir    See pkg/content_root above.

     --disable-ops op_list      See pkg/disable_ops above.

     --debug features           See pkg/debug above.

     --file-root path           See pkg/file_root above.

     --log-access dest          See pkg/log_access above.

     --log-errors dest          See pkg/log_errors above.

     --mirror                   See pkg/mirror above.

     --proxy-base url           See pkg/proxy_base above; ignored if
                                empty value is provided.

     --readonly                 See pkg/readonly above.

     --sort-file-max-size bytes See pkg/sort_file_max_size above.

     --ssl-cert-file source     See pkg/ssl_cert_file above.

     --ssl-dialog type          See pkg/ssl_dialog above.

     --ssl-key-file source      See pkg/ssl_key_file above.

     --writable-root path       See pkg/writable_root above.

     Additional administrative and management functionality for
     package repositories is provided by pkgrepo(1).

DEPOT CONFIGURATION

     When a configuration file is provided (instead of an smf(5) FMRI)
     using the --cfg option, the depot server will read and write all
     configuration data (listed in DESRIPTION above) in a simple text
     format that consists of sections, lead by a "[section]" header,
     and followed by "name = value" entries, with continuations, etc.
     in the style of RFC 822.  Values can be split over multiple lines
     by beginning continuation lines with whitespace.

     Any required values not provided in the configuration file must
     be provided using the option listed in OPTIONS above.  A sample
     configuration file might look like this:

     [pkg]
     port = 80
     inst_root = /var/pkg/repo

     [pub_example_com]
     feed_description = example.com's software
       update log

EXAMPLES
     Example 1:  Enabling the depot server.

     # svcadm enable application/pkg/server

     Example 2:  Changing the listening port of the server.

     # svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop pkg/port = 10000
     # svcadm refresh application/pkg/server
     # svcadm restart application/pkg/server

     Example 3:  Enabling the mirror.

     # svcadm enable application/pkg/dynamic-mirror

     Example 4:  Changing the listening port of the server.

     # svccfg -s application/pkg/server setprop pkg/port = 20000
     # svcadm refresh application/pkg/server
     # svcadm restart application/pkg/server

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     PKG_REPO                   Specifies the directory containing the
                                repository to server.  This will be
                                ignored if -d was used.

     PKG_DEPOT_CONTENT          Specifies the directory containing
                                static content served by the depot.
                                The files listed below under FILES
                                should be present in this directory,
                                although their content may differ
                                from the supplied default content.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Successful operation.

     1     Error encountered.

     2     Invalid command line options were specified.

FILES
     /var/pkg/repo              Default repository location; modify
                                pkg/inst_root to select an

NOTES
     The image packaging system is an under-development feature.
     Command names, invocation, formats, and operations are all
     subject to change.  Development is hosted in the OpenSolaris
     community at:

     http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project+pkg/

     The pkd.depotd service is managed by the service management
     facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:

          svc:/application/pkg/server

     The mDNS mirror service is managed by the service management
     facility, smf(5), under the service identifier:

          svc:/application/pkg/dynamic-mirror

     Because the depot server and mirror expect to be run by an smf(5)
     restarter, they do not daemonize.  Error messages are generally
     sent to standard output, or to the syslogd(1M) system.

     When publishing individual package files that are greater than
     128MB in size, filesystem-based publication must be used due to
     publication protocol limitations.  See pkgsend(1) for more
     information.

     For controlling read access to the depot, it is suggested that
     administrators use an HTTP reverse proxy in combination with
     authentication methods such as client-based SSL certificate
     access which pkg(1) natively supports.

     If new package versions must be added to a public depot, it is
     suggested that filesystem-based publication be performed instead,
     and that the depot server process be restarted afterwards.  For
     more information about filesystem-based publication, see
     pkgsend(1).

     Changes to configuration, or changes to package data using file-
     system based operations require a restart of the depot server
     process so that they can be reflected in operations and output.
     This can be done by using one of the following methods:

        * using svcadm(1M) to restart the application/pkg/server
          instance

        * sending a SIGUSR1 signal to the depot server process using
          kill(1), which will execute a 'graceful restart' that leaves
          the process intact, but reloads all configuration, package,
          and search data:

            kill -USR1 <pid>
