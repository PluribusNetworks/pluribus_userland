NAME
     pkgfmt - format a package manifest

SYNOPSIS
     /usr/bin/pkgfmt [package-manifest-file]


DESCRIPTION

     Pkgfmt without the -c option will format a package 
     manifest in a consistant manner, wrapping lines at 
     80 characters, sorting actions by type, placing key 
     attributes first, etc.  Pkgfmt tries to be robust
     in the case of lines that don't parse into actions;
     such lines will not appear in sorted order.

     If no arguments are given, pkgfmt will read the stdin
     until EOF, and then write the formated manifest on the
     stdout.  Any manifests specified on the command line
     are formated in place.

     Pkgfmt with the -c option will check to make sure the
     manifest(s) are formated in pkgfmt style.

OPTIONS
     
     -c   Check if the manifest is formated in the pkgfmt style.

     -u   Do not wrap lines at 80 characters; this is useful for
          applying traditional text processing tools to package
          manifests.

EXIT STATUS
     The following exit values are returned:

     0     Normal execution

     1     The -c option was specified, and one or more manifests
           are not in pkgfmt-normal form.

     99    An unanticipated exception occurred
