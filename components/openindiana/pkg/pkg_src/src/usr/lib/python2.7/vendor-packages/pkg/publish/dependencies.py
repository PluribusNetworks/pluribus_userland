        # subset of 1's variants.  Dependency 1 is put in the temporary result
        # list (subres) since at least one dependency on pkg_a must exist.

        # Dependency 3 is checked against 4 to see if its variants are a subset.
        # Since they're not, 3's variants are then checked against 5's variants.
        # Since 3's variants are a subset of 5's variants, 3 is merged with 5,
