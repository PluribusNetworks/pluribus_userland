Evaluate the need to add another instance of filesystem/root
============================================================

The infrastructure here provides an extensible mechanism to add 
support for booting off of disparate types of install media. Each
media type is managed as a separate SMF instance of the
filesystem/root service.

The first thing to look at while adding a new media type is to
evaluate if boot style is different enough to warrant creating 
a separate instance of filesystem/root.

If the boot procedure is sufficiently different, create a new 
instance and do the following -

a) Specify the new instance in the live-root-fs.xml manifest
   along the same lines as the 'media' and 'net' instance

b) Evaluate the need to have the newly created instance be a 
   dependant of filesystem/root-minimal. If it makes sense, specify
   that in the live-root-fs-minimal.xml manifest. It should be
   done this way until the bug 6517953 is fixed -

   http://bugs.opensolaris.org/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6517953
c) Enable the appropriate instance of filesystem/root in the DC
   manifest for the relevant media type. It must be noted that 
   *atleast* one instance of filesystem/root must be enabled in
   the media otherwise  SMF will fail to bring up console-login
   successfully.

   This is because startd checks to see if there is *a* way for it
   to get to console-login at start up time (that is, the services
   needed to get to console-login are enabled) and if no instance of
   filesystem/root is enabled (and console-login is dependant upon that)
   then the system execs sulogin and drop you down into console mode.
